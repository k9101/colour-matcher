# Colour Matcher
This is an iOS app to allows users to search for an image on Flickr, generate it's average colour, and set that colour to the view's background image. The goal of the project was to attempt to simply recreate the iTunes album art view and learn a little bit about image processing.

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k9101/colour-matcher/master/sample.png" style="text-align:center; width: auto; height: 300px"/>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k9101/colour-matcher/master/itunes.png" />
</div>

# Usage
Open with Xcode and create an APIKey.swift file with a static API_KEY class member, which contains your personal Flickr API key.
